# Coursera Practical Machine Learning Project
Coursera Machine Learning Project Work Files  
1. Machine Learning Project.Rmd  
2. Machine Learning Project.md  
3. Machine Learning Project.html  

There are 2 branches in the github.  
* Master : Contains the .Rmd, .md, .html file and other supporting files  
* gh-pages : Contains the .html file and other supporting files  

To View the Markdown file directly in Gitbug, click on the .md file. Github does not recognize the .Rmd file. It will display the raw .Rmd file ( does not evaluate commands ), but it will properly display the .md file with commands evaluated.  

If you prefer to look at the html file there are 2 options  
* Download the repo locally to your machinea and view the .html file  
* Directly use this link to see it in the browser
